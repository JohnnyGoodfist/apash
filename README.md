## üëÄ Introduction
Bash and more generally shells are popular command-line and scripting languages that are widely used on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. Nervetheless, it always happen to reinvent basic operations like split, trim... by ourself. 
Again we re-invent again these features üòÖ by trying to looks like Apache's libraries realized in JAVA to simplify their usage in shell, especially for people doing DevOps.

## <a id="quick-start" ></a>üì¶ Installation
As other shell projects, there are unfortunately no standard way to install Apash. But here the main's one:
### [Basher](https://www.basher.it/) 
It's a package manager for bash which helps you quickly to install, uninstall and update bash packages (available on github) from the command line.
```bash
# Install Basher 
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basherpm/basher/master/install.sh" | bash

# Install Apash
basher install "hastec-fr/apash"

# Add the following line to your .bashrc file (and open a new terminal) 
# or use it directly in the prompt to activate it for the current session.
include "hastec-fr/apash" "apash"
```

### Raw
Clone or download the Apash project, then source the main script 
or add it to your profile and open a new terminal.
```bash
source "hastec-fr/apash/apash"
```

### <a id="dependencies" ></a> Dependencies
Some prerequisite could be required if you want to contribute to the project.
For Testing purpose, you need to install [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).
```bash
basher install "bats-core/bats-core"
```
For Documentation purpose, you need to install [shdoc](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc).
```bash
basher install "reconquest/shdoc"
```

## <a id="quick-start" ></a>‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start
Once Apash is installed, you can easily use the function by importing the package you desire by using command "import" with the name of the package.
```bash
# Java style to import all methods from StringUtils
apash.import "fr.hastec.apash.commons-lang.StringUtils"
StringUtils.substring "Hello World" 0 4
```
Do you see the üî•Hellüî• ? It's just the beginning.<br/>
If it's not the case, lets have a look to the troubleshooting section.

```bash
# Import only a single method
apash.import "fr.hastec.apash.commons-lang.StringUtils.indexOf"
StringUtils.indexOf "Gooood Morning" "M"
# result: 7 (yes because it start from index 0 ^^)
```

If you don't like this way of import, you can still use the bash source. But note that an import is done inside.
```bash
source fr/hastec/apash/commons-lang/StringUtils.sh
```

## <a id="documentation" ></a> üìñ Documentation
Apash is auto documented using the project [shdoc](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc). Each file contains an header following the formalism of shdoc in order to generate the corresponding markdown file (.md) in the doc directory.<br>
Let's [explore the features](doc/bash/fr/hastec/apash.md) !!

To generate the documentation, you need to install the tool [shdoc](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc) (ref. [dependencies](#dependencies)). Once installed, generate the documentation from the root project directory with the main apash command.
```bash
  apash doc
```

## <a id="tests" ></a> üß™ Tests
Apash tests are realized with the tool [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) (ref. [dependencies](#dependencies)). Once installed, launch the campaign of tests from the root project directory.
```bash
  apash test
```

## <a id="tests" ></a> ‚ú® Tips
### Naming
If you don't like the long name, you can create your own aliases (as usually).
```bash
  alias import="apash.import"
  alias trim="StringUtils.trim"
```
Just keep in mind, that aliases are usefull for your prompt but (depending of the shell) they cannot be exported naturally. By example for bash, you should source again the alias from subscript or activate the shell option (on your own):
```
  shopt -s expand_aliases
```

## <a id="troubleshooting" ></a> ‚ùì Troubleshooting
### I have modified a library but it's not taken into account
The "import" function replace "." from packages by "/" and it allows to source all scripts from a directory. In addition, it prevents cycling import of re-loading librairies.

It's possible to fore the reload of a libraries (but not recursively to prevent cycling dependencies).
```bash
  # Reload libraries (Re-Source)
  apash.import -f path.to.the.library
```
